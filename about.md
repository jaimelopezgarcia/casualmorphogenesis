I am Jaime, a physicist with no special interest on juggling, and who thinks that Star Wars is the most overrated saga ever. It is the first thing a kid with adhd raised in an arcade would come up with, when asked about spatial mumbo jumbo.


I see myself as an aspiring cybernetist. Don't ask me for a specific definition of that, I just move on hunchs. I know that I like to follow every direction that pulls me toward the intersection point of the lame Venn diagram below.

 I currently work at the petrochemistry industry ( changing the system from the inside, hehe), doing a wide range of applied-math stuff and some machine-learning when I have no other option.

 Besides this, I enjoy arranging fingerstyle guitar versions of songs I like, getting booed at stand up places and making silly <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/6c0sxYSJxymNuTYwaOj3IA?si=PyWkMLKuTESiV8F-qvj9Cg">songs</a> that will be just bad music if you don't speak spanish.

 I hope someone find some posts useful.

 Yours sincerely; Jaime.
